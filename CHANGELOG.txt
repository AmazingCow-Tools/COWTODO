version 0.1:
[Aug 11 2015] - Finish the basic implementation.
                The cowtodo can search in specified folders,
                print in Long and Short modes and have a
                verbose mode that shows every scan and parse.

version 0.1.1:
[Aug 13 2015] - Partially addresses the TODO#7, we are now able
                to specify the exclude paths.
                NOTE: We didn't test this release too much.

version 0.1.2:
[Aug 26 2015] - Complete the TODO#7 and TODO#8, we are now able to specify
                the paths to add or remove permanently in the
                rc file. So all cowtodos calls will ignore those
                paths.

version 0.1.3:
[Sep 11 2015] - cowtodo now check for invalid paths in a rc file and show
                to user if any of them is invalid. Currently it's a fatal
                error, so any invalid path must be corrected before cowtodo
                can run.

version 0.1.4:
[Sep 11 2015] - Add support to uncolored output with the flag --no-colors.

version 0.1.5:
[Sep 11 2015] - Add the shell script extension.
